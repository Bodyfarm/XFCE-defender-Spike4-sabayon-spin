<br>Ultamate ownership of the project as far as I am concered is the Sabayon Linux Foundation. 
<br>
I Michael R. Lawrence , am esentially doing this as a graduate IT security Project , 
<br>and out of Freewill I am Mearly a contributor., 
<br>I am the Lessor of the owners Verses the Sabayon Linux & Linux comunity as a whole. 
<br>whom with all my toil , I do hope , shall benfit all, 
<br>even if I remain mostly nameless.

<br>I mearly "bowrrowing code", then trying to make a few improvements, even if I wrote it, 
contributed it. I'm just a User trying to help out, my programing is feeble. 
<br>Infistructure support (Network admin Windows/Linux) and IT security Admin are the trade craft I know best. 
<br>not having good Security tools to do the job and upto date and having to defend a network or two , 
<BR>is a sore spot I know well.

<h3>Pardon me while I make a mess of things for a bit , then consolidate down , 
release a good Sabayon Spin canidate.</h3>
