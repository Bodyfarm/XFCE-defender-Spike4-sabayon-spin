Zorro-defender
==============

Sabayon Forensics Release packagelist set from Wolfden with a 
Few Packages swiped from Pentoo and others for a Combined Comprehensive IT Security Auditors Spin , 
and sucruity Managment suite.


Powered by Sabayon Linux . 
DVD Spec should come soon.

Issues ATM thier are packages not yet on mainline or limbo to keep the Security packages supported. 

Pros Petoo is good , 
Cons Pentoo can at times especialy on some laptops be a royal bitch to install. 
Pros Backtrack / Kali Linux , Easy to install , 
Cons any source packages may not build right , like they would on a Gentoo based box. 

Sabayon Zorro Spin , Pros well it's Sabayon , with extra toys.
Cons.....me having to build alot of extra crap, 
Having To beg the Sabayon team to try the pentoo particles. 
having to do tons of reserch along side my other Masters Degree classwork....
Cons? other than some extra menu widigts to make the extra goodies eassier to find for the user thier should be none. 
"Zorro" is the Alpha/Beta name  Defneder is my Suggestioed Name.   
however I hope to leave it in the hands of the Sabayon Comunity, as for the final name.
